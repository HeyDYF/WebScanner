# AWVS based Web Vulnerability Scanner
This project aims to study the design and implementation of a vulnerability scanning system based on AWVS, utilizing the AWVS API to build an automated and efficient vulnerability scanning system that implements full automatic website vulnerability scanning, directory scanning, fingerprint identification, port scanning, and other important functions. The system is mainly divided into a Web platform client and a Web platform management end, developed using Python and implemented with the Django framework. The client uses front-end components such as Echarts and Tabler for display, combined with the AWVS API, dirsearch tools, etc., and is completed with a B/S architecture design and implementation. The management end uses the SimpleUI framework to improve the default Django backend. The client includes three major functional modules: vulnerability scanning, information collection, and asset collection. The management end includes several major modules such as fingerprint components, port lists, middleware vulnerability scanning management, and user and permission management. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e414c5e-4b5b-4aeb-be9a-ccd5c8f59f15)
